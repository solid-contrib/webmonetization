Creating an open source Solid application that will let users easily publish, create, and monetize custom pages showcasing writing, music and video content hosted in their Solid Pod at a domain of their choosing. Existing platforms that allow users to monetize their content require either the skills and capitalization to maintain custom web infrastructure or a willingness to let a third party become a steward of both content and data about content creators. itme.online will provide a new option for users who would like to maintain full sovereignty over their content and monetize it without running a web server. Building on top of Solid and Web Monetization means that users will be free to move their content off of itme without interrupting the monetization of their content. In addition to Tani, the team includes Ian Davis and Travis Vachon, and is advised by [Dr Dédé Tetsubayashi and her team](https://incluu.us).

Enabling Web Monetization by default in all open source implementations of the Solid pod server specification. Also, making changes to Darcy Social, a Solid-based social space, so that payments end up at the actual creator of the content that is being viewed, even if it's embedded in a newsfeed.

## Web Monetization for Solid based Data Spaces

Standardizing the agreements for conditional data sharing between data owner and data user to allow Solid Pod owners to monetize their data. Pods re-decentralize the web by giving people a way to store their data, and make it available to others while keeping full data ownership. Interledger offers a perfect solution for micro-payments without the need for complex and centralized payment providers. 

Combining [ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/) + Interledger.

## Reciprocal ecosystem for decentralized health-data

Researching and building a proof of concept as a first step towards a new financial and data ecosystem combining Solid Webapps, Solid Pods, and Web Monetization. Users will pay webapps to access supportive health webapps and process and store their data on their Solid Pod. Researchers get access to data of the user’s Solid Pod and pay the user for the data, with respect for privacy and consent. This will support health improvements on both a personal and community level, will give people control over their data, and will simultaneously nourish academic research institutes with data from more diverse groups.
